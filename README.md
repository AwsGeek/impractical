# (im)Practical Projects
I save this designation for code projects that I work on late at night that have no real purpose other than they allow me to experiment with new AWS services or features. I'm not so much interested in the the destination if you will, as I am in the path I took to ge there. The means justify the ends.

__Note:__ Code contained in these projects is for experimental and illustrative purposes only. There is often ZERO error handling included and no guarantee that they will even work for you. If you copy from one of these projects as-is into your application, well ... you're responsible for any bad things that happen. You have been warned.
